# Day 6: Data Loading, Cleaning, Handling Missing Data

## Summary of Key Concepts

### 1. Data Loading
- Pandas provides functions: `read_csv()`, `read_excel()`, `read_json()`, `read_sql()`.
- Understand and set parameters such as `delimiter`, `header`, `index_col`, `dtype`.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Inspect data using `.info()`, `.head()`, `.describe()`.
- Detect and handle outliers, inconsistent data formats, duplicates.
- Rename columns with `.rename()`.
- Change data types with `.astype()`.

### 3. Handling Missing Data
- Missing data represented as `NaN` or None.
- Detect missing: `.isna()`, `.notna()`.
- Remove missing: `.dropna()`.
- Fill missing: `.fillna()` with a value or method (forward fill, backward fill).
- Interpolate missing data.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Always inspect missing data patterns before filling or dropping.
- Use domain knowledge when deciding how to handle missing data.
- Document all data cleaning steps for reproducibility.
- Leverage pipeline frameworks like scikit-learnâ€™s `Pipeline` for automation.

## Answers to Deep Questions

### Understanding Concepts

1. **Why is data cleaning crucial before model training?**  
   Dirty or inconsistent data can lead to incorrect model learning, bias, poor performance, and unreliable predictions. Cleaning ensures data quality, consistency, and accurate representation of real-world phenomena.

2. **How does Pandas interpret missing values when loading data?**  
   Pandas recognizes special markers like empty cells, `NaN`, `null`, or blanks as missing values. It automatically converts these to `NaN` (float type) internally, which it uses for missing data handling.

3. **Difference between `.dropna()` and `.fillna()`.**  
   - `.dropna()` removes rows or columns with missing data, which may reduce dataset size.  
   - `.fillna()` replaces missing values with a specified value/strategy, keeping data size intact but possibly introducing bias.

4. **What are common strategies to handle missing values in datasets?**  
   Common strategies include:  
   - Removing missing data (`dropna`) if sparse.  
   - Filling with statistics (mean/median/mode).  
   - Forward-fill/backward-fill for time series.  
   - Interpolation to estimate missing points.  
   - Model-based imputation or specialized algorithms.

5. **When to use interpolation for missing values?**  
   Use interpolation when data has presumed continuity or temporal structure, e.g., time series or ordered numeric data, to estimate missing values reasonably between known points.

### Edge Cases

11. **What happens if you call `.dropna()` without parameters?**  
    It drops all rows that contain **any** missing value in any column, which can be very aggressive.

12. **Can filling missing values distort data distribution?**  
    Yes, for example replacing with mean reduces variance and can bias the data towards the mean; uncareful imputation can distort underlying patterns.

13. **How to handle missing data in categorical columns?**  
    Commonly fill with mode (most frequent category) or a new category label like `'Unknown'`.

14. **What is forward fill and backward fill?**  
    - Forward fill (`ffill`) fills missing values with the last known valid value going forward.  
    - Backward fill (`bfill`) fills missing values with the next valid value backwards.

### Advanced Thought

15. **Explain differences and use-cases for imputation strategies.**  
    - Simple imputations: mean/median/mode are easy but may bias data.  
    - Forward/backfill are useful for time series.  
    - Model-based imputations (e.g., KNN, MICE) can predict missing values based on other features but are complex.

16. **How does missing data affect statistical summaries?**  
    Missing data can distort means, variances, and correlations if not properly handled, sometimes leading to biased or incorrect conclusions.

17. **How would you automate data cleaning in a pipeline?**  
    Use frameworks like scikit-learn Pipelines or custom preprocessing functions to apply systematic handling of missing data, encoding, scaling, etc., ensuring reproducibility and integration into modeling workflows.
